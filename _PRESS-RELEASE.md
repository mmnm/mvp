There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

This app helps users keep track of near term goals and guides them to optimize as they are closer to hit the deadline based on mathematical modeling


This app can be useful to people who are close to exams/deadlines to better optimize there time based on the priorities of the deadlines.

The app can be your assistant tool to help you achieve your goals and optimized to achieve maximum results based on mathematical modeling techniques

A lot of people are not able to better track their time when they have multiple deadlines and time pressure. They even forget to prioritize their time on tasks to maximize returns.

The app keeps track of tasks and does mathematical modeling to suggest the user the best way to keep track 

"Time cease to exist if unplanned. As humans, we always have more things to achieve and time is not enough. Re-evaluate and make time for priority goals on a continuos basis"

## How to Get Started ##
Start with a small MVP of users input data and performing some of the mathematical modeling on it.

## Customer Quote ##
"Our employees are using GoalsTrackerAssistant for past 3 months. We have seen an upward of 40% completion of important projects on or before time and reduced focus on unimportant projects"
